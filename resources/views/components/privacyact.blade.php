<!-- TERMS AND CONDITIONS -->
        <p  >
        I am of legal age and a resident of the Philippines consent to Teletherapy with Joseph G. Marquez, RPsy. It is a form of psychological service provided via internet technology, which can include consultation, treatment, transfer of medical data, emails, telephone conversations and/or education using interactive audio, video, or data communications. I also understand that teletherapy involves the communication of my medical/mental health information, both orally and/or visually.</p>
   
        <p>
            Teletherapy has the same purpose or intention as psychotherapy or psychological treatment sessions that are conducted in person. However, due to the nature of the technology used, I understand that teletherapy may be experienced somewhat differently than face-to-face treatment sessions.
        </p>

        <p>
            I agree to the following stipulations and rights as a client which had been clearly explained to me.
        </p>
  
        <p>
            Clientâ€™s Rights, Risks, and Responsibilities:
        </p>
        

      <p>  1. I, the client, need to be a resident of the Philippines. (This is a legal requirement for psychologists practicing in this country under a PRC license.)
       </p>
   
       <p>
        2.  I, the client, have the right to withhold or withdraw consent at any time without affecting my right to future care or treatment.
        </p>
        <p>
        3.  The laws that protect the confidentiality of my medical information also apply to teletherapy. As such, I understand that the information disclosed by me during the course of my therapy or consultation is generally confidential. However, there are both mandatory and permissive exceptions to confidentiality, which are described in the general Consent Form I received at the start of my treatment with Joseph G. Marquez, RPsy.
    </p>
    <p>
        4.  I understand that there are risks and consequences of participating in teletherapy, including, but not limited to, the possibility, despite best efforts to ensure high encryption and secure technology on the part of my psychologist, that: the transmission of my information could be disrupted or distorted by technical failures; the transmission of my information could be interrupted by unauthorized persons; and/or the electronic storage of my medical information could be accessed by unauthorized persons.
    </p>
    <p>
        5.  There is a risk that services could be disrupted or distorted by unforeseen technical problems.
    </p>
    <p>
        6.  In addition, I understand that teletherapy based services and care may not be as complete as face-to-face services. I also understand that if my psychologist believes I would be better served by another form of therapeutic services (e.g. face-to-face services) I will be referred to a professional who can provide such services in my area.
    </p>
    <p>
        7.   I understand that I may benefit from teletherapy, but that results cannot be guaranteed or assured. I understand that there are potential risks and benefits associated with any form of psychotherapy, and that despite my efforts and the efforts of my psychologist, my condition may not improve, and in some cases may even get worse.
    </p>
    <p>
        8.  I accept that teletherapy does not provide emergency services. If I am experiencing an emergency situation, I understand that I can call 911 or proceed to the nearest hospital emergency room for help. If I am having suicidal thoughts or making plans to harm myself, I can call the National Center for Mental Health Crisis Hotline at 09178998727 for free 24-hour hotline support. Clients who are actively at risk of harm to self or others are not suitable for teletherapy services. If this is the case or becomes the case in future, my psychologist will recommend more appropriate services. 
    </p>
    <p>
        9. I understand that there is a risk of being overheard by anyone near me if I am not in a private room while participating in teletherapy. I am responsible for (1) providing the necessary computer, telecommunications equipment and internet access for my teletherapy sessions, and (2) arranging a location with sufficient lighting and privacy that is free from distractions or intrusions for my teletherapy session. It is the responsibility of the psychological treatment provider to do the same on their end. 
    </p>
    <p>
        10.   I understand that dissemination of any personally identifiable images or information from the telemedicine interaction to researchers or other entities shall not occur without my written consent. 
    </p>
    <p>
        11.  I understand that there will be no forms of recording during the teletherapy session.
    </p>
    <p>
        12.  The same fee rates will apply for teletherapy as apply for in-person psychotherapy. However, insurance or other managed care providers may not cover sessions that are conducted via telecommunication. If your insurance, HMO, third-party payor, or other managed care provider does not cover electronic psychotherapy sessions, you will be solely responsible for the entire fee of the session. Please contact your insurance company prior to our engaging in teletherapy sessions in order to determine whether these sessions will be covered.
